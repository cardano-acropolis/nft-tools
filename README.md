## Modules

 1. Vending machines, 
 2. a mechanism for verifiably random and fair airdrop, 
 3. a staking mechanism, and

    * Old camera, the combination of the new and the old, anyone comes
      onto the platform, find out what the biggest picture behind the
      crypto, that is the art piece.
    * Maximize the audience that collectively experiences the passion
      of the artist fashioning from the human spirit art. "Art is
      fashioning from the materials of the human spirit that did not
      exist before."

Ready for deliverables: 40 minutes each sit down and watch it.

Timeline for ticket system: Trailor but the trailer promotes the sale

tickets sale date).

replies with an addr suffix.
